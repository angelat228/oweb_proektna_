        <p> <inputtext onclick="funk1()" style="color:palevioletred;"><em>What will art look like in 20 years?</em></p>
        
            <article>
        
        <p> Reports suggest that by 2040 the impacts of human-caused climate change will be unescapable, making it the big issue at the centre of art and life in 20 years’ time. Artists in the future will wrestle with the possibilities of the post-human and post-Anthropocene – artificial intelligence, human colonies in outer space and potential doom.
            “I imagine art in 20 years will be much more fluid than it is today,” curator Jeffreen M Hayes tells BBC Culture, “in the sense of boundaries being collapsed between media, between the kinds of art that is labelled art, in the traditional sense. I also see it being much more representative of our growing and shifting demographics, so more artists of colour, more female-identified works, and everything in between.”

            <p><inputtext onclick="funk2()" style="color:palevioletred;"><em>Nirvana: Inside the Heart and Mind of Kurt Cobain.</em></p>

            <p>"All I need is a break and my stress will be over with,” says the twenty-five-year-old Cobain. “I’m going to get healthy and start over.”

                He’s certainly earned a break after playing nearly 100 dates on four continents in five months, never staying in one place long enough for to have a doctor to tend to his stomach problem. And he and his band mates, bassist Chris Novoselic (pronounced nova-SELL-itch) and drummer Dave Grohl, have had to cope with the peculiar position of being the world’s first triple-platinum punk-rock band.
                
                Soon after the September release of Nevermind, MTV pumped “Teen Spirit” night and day as the album vaulted up the charts until it hit Number One. Although the band’s label, DGC, doubted the album would sell over more than 250,000 copies, it sold 3 million in just four months and continues to sell nearly 100,000 copies a week.
                Cobain denies he is using heroin. “I don’t even drink anymore because it destroys my stomach,” he protests. “My body wouldn’t allow me to take drugs if I wanted to, because I’m so weak all the time.

                “All drugs are a waste of time,” he continues. “They destroy your memory and your self-respect and everything that goes along with your self-esteem. They make you feel good for a little while, and then they destroy you. They’re no good at all. But I’m not going to go around preaching against it. It’s your choice, but in my experience, I’ve found they’re a waste of time.”
                When Nevermind hit number one, Cobain was “kind of excited,” he says. “I wouldn’t admit that at the time. I just hope that it doesn’t end with us. I hope there are other bands that can keep it going.”
